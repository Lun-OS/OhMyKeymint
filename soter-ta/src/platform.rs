//! Platform facts the pure core cannot know.
//!
//! A stock Soter TA signs only inside a fresh biometric match, and it reads that
//! match where it lives: in the secure world, from the fingerprint TA. The
//! software TA is an ordinary user-space process, so the closest it can get is
//! the framework's accepted-capture counter, which the daemon reads through the
//! hooks registered here (`soterta_set_platform`).
//!
//! A mark packs the daemon's per-boot tag in the high [`BOOT_TAG_SHIFT`] bits and
//! the counter in the low 32, so two marks are only comparable inside one boot:
//! a counter that restarted with the device must never look like evidence. The
//! daemon keeps the packed value non-negative on purpose — a negative answer is
//! this module's "cannot tell" — so the tag has to fit in 31 bits.
